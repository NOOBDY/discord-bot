# Discord Bot

command prefix: `.`

usage: `.[command]`

example: `.help`



This is a discord bot I created for fun, more features will probably be coming, or not, IDK.



## Test

### bot

deletes the message sent by the user then echoes it, making the bot say anything you want

`.bot [your message here]`

### echo

echoes the message sent by the user

`.echo [message]`

### ping

returns "pong", nothing exciting

`.ping`



## Weird

### image

returns one of the first ten image results on google images

`.image [keywords can contain more than one word]`

### porn

returns one of the first ten video results from Canada's largest website (this will return irrelevant results if nothing is found)

`.porn [this can also contain multiple keywords]`



## No Category

### Clear

clears a given amount of messages or 100 by default

`.clear [amount(optional)]`

### help

returns the help message, containing all commands

`.help`

### load

loads modules, don't touch this unless you know what you're doing

`.load [module]`

### unload

unloads modules, also not recommended to use

`.unload [module]`
